## How to Set Up MongoDB

This project uses MongoDB to store form submissions. Follow the steps below to set up MongoDB for this repository.

### 1. Create a MongoDB Atlas Database
MongoDB Atlas is a cloud-based database service. To set it up:

- Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
- Sign up or log in
- Create a new **Cluster**
- Choose a **Shared Cluster (Free Tier)**
- Select a cloud provider and region
- Click **Create Cluster** and wait for deployment

### 2. Get the Connection String
Once the cluster is ready:

- Navigate to **Database Deployments**
- Click **Connect** â†’ **Drivers**
- Select **Node.js** and **Version 4.0 or later**
- Copy the **Connection String**, which will look like this:

```bash
mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```
- Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with your database credentials.

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
In the root directory, create or update your `.env.local` file:

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/xyl-token?retryWrites=true&w=majority
MONGODB_DB=xyl-token
```
- Replace <username> and <password> with your actual MongoDB credentials.

With that done, you can now read and write data to your new MongoDB cluster.
